# Latin-Squares
Hello friends!
This is one of the game implementation that i had been working on fews days and here it is solved by creating an amazing game for Kids.
# What is Latin Squares?
Basically Latin Squares are the N * N matrix 
where N = number of elements
So, here the principle of Latin Squares states that - no element should be repeated in any row nor in any column.
and hence reducing the redundancy.
